## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

-	Why Python programming is awesome
-	What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
-	What is a subclass
-	How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
-	When can an instance have new attributes
-	How to inherit class from another
-	How to define a class with multiple base classes
-	What is the default class every class inherit from
-	How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
-	Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
-	What is the purpose of inheritance
-	What are, when and how to use *isinstance*, *issubclass*, *type* and *super* built-in functions

## Tasks

# 0. Lookup

Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:

-	Prototype: **def lookup(obj):**
-	Returns a **list** object
-	You are not allowed to import any module

**File**: *0-lookup.py*

# 1. My list

Write a class *MyList* that inherits from *list*:

-	Public instance method: *def print_sorted(self):* that prints the list, but sorted (ascending sort)
-	You can assume that all the elements of the list will be of type *int*
-	You are not allowed to import any module

### Feel free to PERUSE through the repository and see various ways to:

-	inherit from a Python class
-	use and update default methods and attributes

## Documentation

-	Do not use the words *import* or *from* inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
