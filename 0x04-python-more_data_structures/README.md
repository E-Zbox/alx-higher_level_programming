## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

-	Why Python programming is awesome
-	What are sets and how to use them
-	What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
-	When to use sets versus lists
-	How to iterate into a set
-	What are dictionaries and how to use them
-	When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
-	What is a key in a dictionary
-	How to iterate over a dictionary
-	What is a lambda function
-	What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Tasks

# 0. Squared simple

File: *`0-square_matrix_simple.py`*

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

-	Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
-	`matrix` is a 2 dimensional array
-	Returns a new matrix:
        -	Same size as `matrix`
        -	Each value should be the square of the value of the input

# 12. Roman to integer

File: *`12-roman_to_int.py`*

Create a function `def roman_to_int(roman_string):` that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

-	You can assume the number will be between 1 to 3999.
-	`def roman_to_int(roman_string)` must return an integer
-	If the `roman_string` is not a string or `None`, return 0

### Feel free to PERUSE through this repository and see various ways set, dictionary data structures are used in the Python programming language
