## Background Context

Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, letâ€™s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

-	Why Python programming is awesome
-	What is an object
-	What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
-	What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
-	What is a reference
-	What is an assignment
-	What is an alias
-	How to know if two variables are identical
-	How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
-	How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
-	What is mutable and immutable
-	What are the built-in mutable types
-	What are the built-in immutable types
-	How does Python pass variables to functions

**Others**: Wassup with you and learning Python?

## Tasks

# 0. Who am I?

What function would you use to print the type of an object?

Write the name of the function in the file, without `()`.
